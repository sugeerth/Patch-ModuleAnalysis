# Interactive Visual Analysis of Patch Module Data in the Analysis of log files from SuperComputers #

The area of analyzing and visualizing complicated data in the context of supercomputer applications---multi-core computer architectures that require us to devisenew ways of visaulizing system data and understanding system behavior. 

One of the particular simulation type that I was working on was called the adaptive-mesh-refinement simulation. 
AMR simulations attempt to replicate the behavior of very complex physical phenomena in space and time. 

Available computing reseources are assigned to specific parts of the the domain over which a simulation is executed, and it is of great importance and interest to better understand how a supercomputing system assigns computing resources to specific parts of the physical domain of the supercomputer. 

This tool features and analysis modules that allow one to interactively explore the complex system behavior. 

The tool works in conjunction with the Box Fish

# Patch Module #
Patch Module is a module of the larger analysis tool "Boxfish" that visualizes perfomance data across the application domain. Novel visualizations are contribtued in this module. Few of the visualizations include:

Slicing and dicing visualizations depicting changes in application domain.

Keeping constant a specific area ofinterest with varying levels of opacity of the context information

Exploration of the simulation data over multiple scales of spatial granularity. The visualization depicts similar behavior across different levels of understanding.
